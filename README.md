## Features

- User authentication
- Student enrollment with face recognition
- Automated attendance taking using facial recognition
- Attendance statistics and reports
- Google Sheets integration for attendance records

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)**
   - User interface for all features
   - Webcam integration for capturing photos
   - Responsive design

2. **Backend (Django + REST API)**
   - Face recognition processing
   - Database for storing student information
   - Google Sheets API integration
   - PDF report generation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later) and npm (v6.x or later) for the frontend
- Python 3.8+ for the backend
- dlib and OpenCV for face recognition
- Google API credentials for Sheets integration

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
    cd django_backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Django backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd django_backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download face recognition models**:
   - Download `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` and `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat` from the [dlib website](http://dlib.net/).
   - Place them in the Django backend root directory.

5. **Set up Google API credentials**:
   - Create a service account in Google Cloud Console.
   - Download the credentials JSON file and rename it to `credentials.json`.
   - Place it in the Django backend root directory.

6. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Start the Django server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
